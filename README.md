# 2D-Strip-Packing
C++ w/ Oxygine as a drawing framework.
You need the latest dev build of oxygine-framework to be able to compile.

This is basically my bachelor project done to showcase different basic 2DSP algorithms.

1. Next Fit Decreasing Height (done)
2. First Fit Decreasing Height (done)
3. Best Fit Decreasing Height (done)
4. Knapsack 0-1 (done)
5. Split-Fit (done)
6. Join (done)
7. Floor Ceiling No Rotation (done)

Block generation is mostly random, just a couple of rules to produce some extreme sizes.
